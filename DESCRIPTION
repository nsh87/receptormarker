Description: Provides functions for executing computations on antibody and
    T-cell receptor protein sequences (specifically CDRs) and phenotypic markers.
    Generates visualizations or data suitable
    for visualizing with web-based libraries such as D3.js and Cytoscape Web.
    Types of analyses available include normalization, clustering, phylogenetic
    analysis to build phylogenetic trees, and grouping of adaptive repertoire
    convergence for CDRs. Utilizes and includes existing packages and binaries
    (e.g. HMMER and BLAST+) to perform many analyses, focusing on both
    supplying novel algorithms and making it easer to pipe data into
    pre-existing tools to generate useful visualizations and analyses.
