\usage{
data(tcr)
}
\description{
A data set containing T-cell receptor sequences and
phenotypic markers. Each row corresponds to data for a single cell.
}
\details{
A threshold has been applied to the absolute measurements for the
phenotypic markers in order to make their values `NA` or 1. Presence of a
marker is indicated by 1.
