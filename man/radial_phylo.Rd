\title{Create an interactive radial phylogram}
\usage{
radial_phylo(d, seqs_col = NULL, condense = FALSE, rings = NULL,
  canvas_size = "auto", font_size = 12, scale = TRUE, browser = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE, fast = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A data frame or character vector containing protein sequences.}

\item{seqs_col}{If \code{d} is a data frame, either an integer corresponding
to a column index or a string corresponding to a column name in \code{d}
that contains the sequences. If \code{d} is a character vector,
\code{seqs_col} should be \code{NULL}.}

\item{condense}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}, depending on whether or not the
radial phylogram should only contain unique sequences. If \code{TRUE}, clonal
expansion (i.e. sequence frequency data) will be represented by orthogonal
vertical bars on the perimiter of the phylogram.}

\item{rings}{A named character vector that can be used to create outer-ring
annotations on the radial phylogram. The names of the vector must correspond
to column names in the data.frame \code{d}, and the values should
correspond to a desired value in each column which should be annotated
on the ring. For example, \code{c(FOXP3=1, species="human")} will create
two outer rings, the first of which will be colored whenever the column
"FOXP3" is 1 and the second of which will be colored whenever the column
"species" is "human". Annotations occur on a per-sequence basis when the
PhyloXML represents a non-condensed phylogram. If the PhyloXML represents
a condensed phylogram, annotations occur using individual sequence
populations: if 50\% or more of the cells with a given sequence meet the
current criteria given by \code{rings} then that sequence's ring on the
radial phylogram will be annotated.}

\item{canvas_size}{An integer representing the desired width and height of
the SVG canvas in pixels. Defaults to \code{"auto"} to automatically
estimate the appropriate SVG canvas size. It is suggested to leave this at
the default value and then adjust only if necessary. If parts of the
phylogram are cut off, \code{canvas_size} should be increased. See the
Details section for more information.}

\item{font_size}{An integer font size for the phylogram's labels. It is
suggested to leave this at the default value and then adjust only if
necessary.}

\item{scale}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}, depending on whether or not the
phylogram should scale to fit the browser or RStudio Viewer window. If
\code{FALSE} and the phylogram is on a large canvas, it will be necessary to
scroll to see the entire canvas.}

\item{browser}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}, depending on whether or not the
phylogram should open in a browser window. Only applicable if using RStudio,
which by default will show the phylogram in RStudio's Viewer. If using R from
the command line, the phylogram will always open in a browser.}

\item{verbose}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} additional output
is printed to the R console and the sequences, multiple sequence alignment,
and PhyloXML are written to a folder in the working directory.}

\item{fast}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}, depending on whether or not the fast
NJ (neighbor joining) algorithm in R should be used to build the phylogram.
If \code{FALSE} and Biopython is installed, Biopython's UPGMA algorithm will
be used instead. This method is slower, but it will generate "smarter" trees
and therefore is the default setting. Only applicable if Biopython is
installed and available.}

\description{
Creates a JavaScript-based radial phylogram in RStudio or a
browser window. Intended for use with relatively short amino acid sequences,
particularly those representing the variable chains or complementary
determining regions (CDRs) of antibody or T-cell receptors. Provides several
parameters for customizing the phylogram by visually representing clonal
expansion and/or visually representing phenotypic traits of individual cells
or sequence populations. The phylogram is made available for download as a
PNG.
}
\details{
It is suggested to have Biopython installed and available to R when
using this function. If Biopython is not available, a warning will be output
when loading the package and running this function. Biopython is able to
create a more visually appealing and "smarter" tree using the UPGMA
algorithm. If Biopython is not available, \code{\link[ape]{bionj}} will be
used to create a tree purely in R.

It is important to note the difference between \code{canvas_size} and
\code{scale} when adjusting those arguments. The phylogram is drawn on an SVG
canvas. As more sequences, rings, or bars are added to the phylogram, the
radius of the phylogram must increase in order to prevent all that
information from overlapping. Consequently, the SVG canvas needs to grow to
accommodate the growing phylogram. If the growth of the canvas does not keep
up with the growth of the phylogram, the phylogram will either be cut off at
the horizontal and vertical edges of the canvas (which is akin to an HTML
\code{<div>}) or squashed the by small canvas. The argument
\code{canvas_size} has everything to do with the initial draw of the
phylogram. In contrast, \code{scale} has nothing to do with the size of the
phylogram during its initial draw, but rather everything to do with the
scaling of the phylogram \emph{after it has already been drawn}. The
phylogram will only be drawn once, since scaling does not initiate a redraw.
Therefore any anomolies in the drawing of the phylogram should be addressed
using \code{canvas_size}.

\strong{TIP:} When experimenting or crafting a large or complex phylogram,
such as a condensed phylogram with several annotations, set \code{fast=TRUE}
to iterate quickly and when the ideal settings have been found change to
\code{fast=FALSE} to build the final phylogram.

\strong{TIP:} If the desired outcome is a PNG image of the phylogram, set
\code{scale=FALSE, browser=TRUE} and then use the "Download PNG" button in
the upper-left of the browser window to save the phylogram as a full-sized
PNG.
